This module helped me understand Git on a deeper level, especially how branches actually work in real projects. Before this, I thought branching was just making copies of files, but now I understand that branches let developers work on different features without messing up the main code. Seeing how branches merge back together helped everything make more sense.

One of the more confusing parts for me was handling merge conflicts. At first it looked intimidating, but once I practiced resolving conflicts, I realized it’s mostly about carefully choosing which changes to keep. It also showed me how important communication is when multiple people are working in the same repository.

I also learned about commands like cherry-pick, reset, and clean. Cherry-pick was interesting because it lets you move specific changes between branches instead of merging everything. Reset and clean showed me how Git can undo mistakes or remove files, which is helpful but also something I need to be careful with so apparent changes aren’t lost.

Overall, this module made Git feel more realistic to how teams actually use it. I’m still learning and need more practice, but I feel more confident working with repositories, branches, and resolving problems when they happen.
